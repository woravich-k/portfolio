                                I graduated my bachelour's from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand majoring in survey engineer in 2013. There are several certificates that can guarantee my academic success, such as first class honors, gold medal, engineering role model 2013, etc. Even though this course did not focus only on GIS, it contains a variety of positioning methods, including GNSS, remote sensing, photogrammetry and plain surveying, which gave me the chance to recognize data-behavior and improve my understanding to the level that I am capable of analyzing spaitial data efficiently. The course also allowed me to develop my programing skills, as there were several exercises which had to be solved by coding, including my final project.

                                After I had graduated, I decided to discover working life before continuing to learn as a student. As a GIS technical support at ESRI Thailand, the sole authorized distributor of ESRI Inc. in Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, I was responsible for providing appropriate GIS solutions to various kinds of Thai and others’ organizations. Researching a huge range of GIS technologies especially ESRI products was one of the most important tasks for this job and that drove me to be a better self-learner. Furthermore, I obtianed experience customizing and programming python script to create customised tools. Although I specialise in ArcGIS Network Analyst extension, I am familiar with most kinds of ESRI products: Desktop Software, Web GIS and Mobile Applications.

                                During the job at Esri Thailand, I've realised the power of GIS and was attacted to deepen my knowledge in this field. So I went straight to study MSc. GIS at the University Colledge London (UCL), London, the UK, one of the most renowned universities. I gathered a lot of invaluable experience and rapidly improved various skills such as database management, web and mobile application development, and machine learning methods. I did not recieve only knowledge from the text books and class rooms, but also absorbed various perspectives and experienced numerous use cases from multinational lecturers and colleagues.

							Some people might misunderstand that I spent most of the time in school focusing on the lessons. In fact, I always had plenty of time participating other activities. As paticipating those activities, I had gathered experience and developed numerous skills, especially comunication, leadership, management, socialising and teamworking skills.

                                 One of the activities worth mentioned was my membership of SJM volunteer for rural development club. Having been a member of this club, I had the chance to join several volunteer camps helping underdeveloped schools and children in the rural  of Thailand mainly by constructing their education buildings and teaching local pupils. Moreover, I also joined the Esri Thailand voluntary camp, which also supported a disadvantaged school in Prachinburi Province, Thailand.

                                I'd been a jounior tennis players since I was 12. Experiencing numerous tournaments drove me to become stroger both mentally and phisically, and thought me how to cope with and learn from disappointment of losing. Nowadays, although I do not play sports for competition anymore, I still would love to do play any kinds of sports for my health.

                                I also frequently spend my free time to play both video games as well as board games. I believe speding the proper amount of time on statigic games could develop my logical thinking and planning skills.
