                               I graduated my bachelor’s from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand majoring in survey engineer in 2013. There are several certificates that can guarantee my academic success, such as first-class honours, gold medal, engineering role model 2013, etc. Even though this course did not focus only on GIS, it contains a variety of positioning methods, including GNSS, remote sensing, photogrammetry and plain surveying, which gave me the chance to recognize data-behaviour and improve my understanding to the level that I am capable of analysing spatial data efficiently. The course also allowed me to develop my programming skills, as there were several exercises which had to be solved by coding, including my final project.

                                After I had graduated, I decided to discover working life before continuing to learn as a student. As a GIS technical support at ESRI Thailand, the sole authorized distributor of ESRI Inc. in Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, I was responsible for providing appropriate GIS solutions to various kinds of Thai and others’ organizations. Researching a huge range of GIS technologies especially ESRI products was one of the most important tasks for this job and that drove me to be a better self-learner. Furthermore, I obtained experience customizing and programming python script to create customised tools. Although I specialise in ArcGIS Network Analyst extension, I am familiar with most kinds of ESRI products: Desktop Software, Web GIS and Mobile Applications.

                               During the job at Esri Thailand, I've realised the power of GIS and was attracted to deepen my knowledge in this field. So, I went straight to study MSc. GIS at the University College London (UCL), London, the UK, one of the most renowned universities. I gathered a lot of invaluable experience and rapidly improved various skills such as database management, web and mobile application development, and machine learning methods. I did not receive only knowledge from the text books and class rooms, but also absorbed various perspectives and experienced numerous use cases from multinational lecturers and colleagues.

							Some people might misunderstand that I spent most of the time in school focusing on the lessons. In fact, I always had plenty of time participating other activities. As participating those activities, I had gathered experience and developed numerous skills, especially communication, leadership, management, socialising and teamworking skills.

                                 One of the activities worth mentioned was my membership of SJM volunteer for rural development club. Having been a member of this club, I had the chance to join several volunteer camps helping underdeveloped schools and children in the rural of Thailand mainly by constructing their education buildings and teaching local pupils. Moreover, I also joined the Esri Thailand voluntary camp, which also supported a disadvantaged school in Prachinburi Province, Thailand.

                                I'd been a junior tennis player since I was 12. Experiencing numerous tournaments drove me to become stronger both mentally and physically, and thought me how to cope with and learn from disappointment of losing. Nowadays, although I do not play sports for competition anymore, I still would love to do play any kinds of sports for my health.

                                I also frequently spend my free time to play both video games as well as board games. I believe spending the proper amount of time on strategic games could develop my logical thinking and planning skills.
